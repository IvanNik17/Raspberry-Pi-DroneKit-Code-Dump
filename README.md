# Raspberry Pi DroneKit Code Dump
 A code dump containing various functions for creating a autonomous drone using Python and Dronekit on the Raspberry Pi. A Hokuyo LiDAR is used for drone orientation

The code is not commented and is quite messy. If you want to make heads or tails of it - start from **mainProgram_beta_hokuyo.py**. The code can be easily changed to use other LiDAR solutions. In addition, it uses an external IMU - the BNO-055 through an Arduino.
